hi
Dear Team,

As today marks my last working day at Société Générale, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks to each of you.

Working alongside such a talented and collaborative team has been a truly rewarding experience. From solving complex technical challenges to sharing light moments during breaks, each interaction has contributed to both my professional growth and fond memories.

A special thanks to everyone who supported me throughout my journey here — your guidance, knowledge-sharing, and camaraderie have meant a lot.

Though I’m moving on to new challenges, I’ll carry forward everything I’ve learned here. I sincerely hope our paths cross again in the future.

Please feel free to stay in touch:

Wishing you all continued success and great achievements ahead.
