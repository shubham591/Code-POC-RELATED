Hello Team,

I wanted to share that I have decided to move on from my current role, and I have submitted my resignation. My last working day will be at the beginning of May.

It’s been an incredible journey working alongside such talented and supportive colleagues. I truly appreciate the opportunities I’ve had to learn and grow here. I’ll make sure to complete my handovers and assist in ensuring a smooth transition.

Thank you all for the guidance, collaboration, and great memories. I look forward to staying connected and wish the team continued success.

Best,
Shubham
