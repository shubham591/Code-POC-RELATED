Subject: Update on Qualys Vulnerabilities Issues

Hi All,

As discussed earlier, we have been working on addressing the Qualys Vulnerabilities Issues. However, we have encountered an unforeseen hurdle that might delay the completion of this task beyond the initially committed deadline of 31st of this month.

Please rest assured that we are proactively working to resolve the issue and have allocated two resources to focus on it. We will closely monitor progress and provide regular updates as we move forward.

We would also like to highlight that this delay may impact other committed deliveries. We are reviewing the timelines and will communicate any changes promptly to keep everyone aligned.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please let us know if there are any concerns or further discussions needed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Feel free to adjust it further based on your tone or style preferences!
